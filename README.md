# Notex

Notex is a simple note-taking application that allows you to upload your notes from your classes. It is built using Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, with Supabase as the database service.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

Provide executable permissions to the `start.sh` script to ensure it can be run as a program.

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
```

### Run Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This will launch the application and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
